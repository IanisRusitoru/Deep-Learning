Please find attached a link to the Google Drive folder containing the data and project files for our analysis:

To access the files, simply click on the link and sign in to your Google account.

We have preprocessed the data for our analysis and made it available on Google Drive for your convenience. The preprocessed data is in a file called 'reduced_dataset.zip'. 
This file contains the data in a ready-to-use format, with all necessary preprocessing steps already completed. To access the file, simply click on the link and sign in
to your Google account. 

Please note that the first two notebooks in our project are designed to be run locally, as the original data is not in the appropriate structure for Google Colab. 
Running these notebooks on Google Colab may result in storage problems due to the size of the original data. 
However, the remaining three notebooks can be run on Google Colab using a GPU for improved performance. 
To run the notebooks on Google Colab, simply click on the link and sign in to your Google account. We recommend using a GPU for these notebooks to reduce processing time. 


Please be aware that there is a possibility of a timeout warning while running the notebooks on Google Colab due to Google restrictions. 
If this occurs, you can try restarting the runtime and rerunning the notebook. We recommend saving your progress frequently to avoid losing any work.
